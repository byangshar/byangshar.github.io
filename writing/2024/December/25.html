I feel my mind clearing clutters.
A slight trepidation occupies my mind. 
A steady note rings on the organ. 
The bruise has become chronic atlast.
I'm a day too late.
Everything happened at once. 
I might vomit.
It's 10 am, in my mind anyway. 
Ignorance is a loop. 
Is art liberation or the story of liberation?
<i>Who's in charge?</i>
Is there a way out of the conundrum of diseases?
<i>Who's in charge?</i>
In a crowd of a-hundred eyes left behind, 
and a hundred living that slight you
and a hundred that open-up and invite;
They're all speak lies.
<i>Who's in charge?</i>
Make up a truth make another, to fall back to.
Even if it shall not fall in line.
Channel the power into a ground
Even if it gives a strange seed never to be studied or found.
<i>Who's in charge?</i>
