<pre class="poem-lines">
When the air gets cold and you're in shivers one morning, after a warm sunset.
When you can't feel your feet anymore and your hands ajustly go rigid, 
not caring for when is time to work that'll make a lifetime for two.
And at night you make your first meal of the day, 
an uninviting fodder to keep you at bay.
And when all hope is lost you take a side on the bed laying, 
your eyes shut, your breath growing longer by the second, 
long sighs, paving way for tears to arrive and fall at your face's side. 
A dagger churns inside of you with every breath you take,
you hate feeling this way but it's the only thing you feel. 
You still mourn for the people you lost,
and throw disdain onto yourself for scars you cast on someone else's skin. 
You wish things were different, and that people saw the labour you did
to keep them together, putting yourself at stake. 
You wish the ones you held closest to you didn't throw you away.
Oh I thank them, look at yourself, 
aren't those blades on your back?
Aren't those bruises starting to fill? 
Look at yourself, I wish your hedonist should go away but you never try.
But even so, look at yourself, 
I really wish you could.
