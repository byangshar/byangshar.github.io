<i>To Wittgenstein,</i>

In a fleeting moment; contradiction.
A pity attempt to preserve a moment. 
"Is for reflection, in the respect of crux, to preserve." 

"You shall not! No redemption, no excuse shall be parsed." 

Drop-down, crumble-dissociate—
a fleeting moment indeed:
In the abode: walls, each one falls—out-and-away.
Then in utter dark, lack of spark—
humility, dread; lack of remorse.
A final pulse, the unsophisticated
flamboyancy comes to rest at last. 

So then falls the urge to pretend:
and so does becoming the banner of false. 
Come unjust pause, you might've found a friend at last. 

The instinct of a prey, the hunter's lust—
in conformation the prey falls,
and your instinct and good-will at large.

The world lies in monotonous indifference;
the Year of Amidst, in its secrecy, and exile falls victim to obscurity.
