<pre class="poem-lines">
Come, as the wicked sun-dial turns, 
clouds cover our heads,
the sky weeps until winter changes its mind,
and walks in through the front door.
Now, the warmth diminishes, and recesses
away from the limbs, towards my chest.
It is here that I sense all life in me rests;
<i>"I apologise for the cowardly retreat,
I offer myself in whole this time.
Perhaps I should learn to let the vice strangle tighter, gradually, around the neck,
not in a single moment.
Death, then is no more a frivolous embrace,
or some decent, sought-escape, or an act of a single polarising moment.
It is a seed to sow, to see it reap, and strangle the insides 
as its roots reach to annihilate the organs for blood,
and it’s established as a parasite."</i>

It's often that I wish to no longer comprehend my tongue,
and forego in regard, all systems that govern my well being and support;
I wish to eternally be in the presence of a choir, not bigger than a quintet,
the fifth being myself.
<i>“The era of research and thesis is past us,
should we still not put up a fight, and conclude in a solus victory of one?
Why should we refrain from seeking the only end we’ve come to know—
and make it beyond the unsurmountable hills that lie eastwards?
If you shalln’t see me in the traditional sense, become my consort, hunger;
the trek is barely a few months long.
Keep lit within me the unrest of an empty stomach, and a throat parched of water,
keep my body away, in pain and misery, away from the woeful embrace of snowbeds.
I shall hold you onto this promise, this is the last thing I shall ask of you.”</i>

Perhaps the sub-human peak was claimed again, 
and beyond that, a brief desert of the east.
Further beyond in the plains, there is a lush green cover and trees all over,
and in those plains is the abode of my lover.
<i>“Let my eyes remain intact until then—
this is surrender, not another escape;
thank you for helping me thus far,
take whatever of mine you must.”</i>
