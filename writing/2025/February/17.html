We cycled up the hill to see the morning mist in the forest down the cliff. 
We sat on the rocks and had a little chat, and a little argument like we always do. 
It ended up in me and you but I gave in first, just as I always would. 
Then came the sudden shower, came down the dark clouds that veiled the sky since the morning hour. 
Our lack of preparation resulted in wet boots and shivers, we blamed a distant terrain for our quivers.
We made the best of the moment in our wet attires, jumped in puddles and slid down the once dry grass meadow.
In all the fun I lost you to the rain, I became a widow.
I still wonder what happened there, in the distant backyard of my home in the valley where the Orphaned rain fell.
