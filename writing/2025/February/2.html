<pre class="poem-lines">
The air holds no sparkle, the sunlight lacks luster.
Breathing no longer brings my chest to a full-bloom.
Is it just the fall or is a lost item the cause?
Is it just me and my convoluted ways afterall?
My valley, the lands amidst an uninhabited mountain range.
Is everything turning to scratch again?
My valley will flood soon,
the river will reap chaos,
it's good knowing that you'll never be back again.
I wish the flood washes me away soon.
Never fly back here, be there, be free.
Goodbye Amidst.
