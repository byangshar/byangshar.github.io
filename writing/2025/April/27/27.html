What would happen 
when two atoms collide
in a lack of medium? 
With speeds of an alpha-particle,
leaving their electrons to abandon.

What would become of matter
sped up to light? 
In what ways would a body burn
and tear apart in the pursuit?
Would as little as a single charge remain
in the room light was chased?

Next came the thought:
How much had to be overlooked
to live in peace, and become 
insurged to seek refuge
in some other person's arms.

Claiming to own the cut earned 
after spending another month in nausea,
in a room where the air is cold, and dead.
While inside, a drone of sickness
weighed the head.

The subconscious ape knows
of little good-times beyond
chasing that friend from childhood again.
The moment lived last a decade ago, 
when choosing a master's was 
the most ‘rigid structure of oppression’ known,
to the kid that’d moved out into another-cell,
of oneself.
To spend in greed,
being deaf for the ones in need,
“had become too common these days”
the old folks would say.
A gamble had to be made:
To overlook joy,
sink in the sand without resistance,
or come running from behind, jump, 
and sink a few steps ahead from everyone else.
The unassuming ones, 
huffed their last sighs in regret.

Regret is dismissal
for the rejection of one's human condition,
much as guilt is unpayable debt.
They share their prey,
tugging it unto either one of their nests,
until the humility gained by it
suggests a certain dullness achieved;
beckoning search for the next.

Beauty lies in handled-restraint,
when well-intent is taken to face,
instead of its tender claim.
When peace is made
with the nexus that shrivels,
and put to rest 
in some remote grave inside the head.
