<pre class="poem-lines">
Dreams, tumble unto the floor
as I wake up and on the bed's side
they crumble upon their fall.
Then tenderness shatters into noting at all.
A mournful reprise that convulses throughout the day, and for months to come,
I turned to my forefathers of thought,
to get the drone shut, for silence at last,
but I couldn't find courage to see them in the eyes;
or be seen by the sublime,
there were a lot of things I'd been already running away from.
The chase would end, but not in my favour.
I was aware, perhaps it was now that I shed away the loose-hanging ties of promises, and an unlived life. 
It'd be strange betrayal that I'd come to face. When I'd be lighter, 
than years of ties that break away,
unbeknownst to all that had to be concerned,
the sole lengths I had walked,
in hopes of earning a companionship atlast. 
There's no formal trade in a function of that sort, I'd finally come to accept.
And as the first of promises fell-off,
a bruise remained,
of neglect that I'd kept myself in,
putting ahead the unconcerned,
and myself at last.
