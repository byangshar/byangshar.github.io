<i>"This might account for nothing, a small shelter in the middle of nowhere"</i>

I penned down the thought, a last word on my behalf before I headed out
with all restraints set aside–I'd rummaged enough to put a bigger cast over the sky:
exhibit myself as normal, during common time.

I took a couple bags: a hefty weight on my shoulders, and currency that has been out of exchange. 
I knew my travel was set to be a long one; 
the present day didn't inspire people to bring stray strangers back home.

By the second day my throat was parched, 
the bills didn't buy much besides amazed, stingy gazes of people. 
Their faces lighting up, as they planned their steps: 
treading across, making the line narrower by the second–
feeling and caressing these relics from olden days.
I can understand the excitement besides, it was a quick way to 'some success', 
tugging away at my bag, or at the soiled notes I possessed.

I lost hearing in my left ear that evening as I went to board the next train, 
fainted and crumbled down with my feet barely inside. 
My head burned beyond the temperate heat of this land; 
maybe it was the lack of water, or food, or being pushed around by the crowd; 
forced to find another way around.

I was begging for any relief at this point, but my voice wouldn't come, 
my pleas laid in shame, too, alongside this big-plan in my head.
And then I got my final nod from god, a kick on the side of my head, 
and I collapsed–on to the floor unkept.

I was sent back, to gaze at the valley I'd dreamed about in my abode.
There wasn't another house besides mine, or a grid of roads covering my sight.
There was not a single other footstep to be heard beyond mine,
but instead leaves of trees giving into the seldom wind passing by,
and at evening the miserable Sun: declaring another flamboyant show of death.
I'd much rather be here, but the crowd had other plans it seems.

<i>"Then so be it! I win the last laugh, however it may be. 
I shall die without being miserable for a single second, unlike the rest!. 
I'm here, and that's enough for me to find peace."</i>
