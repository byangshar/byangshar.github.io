<pre class="poem-lines">
Spanning across the field, being a menace to everyone that passes by.
I huddle the mud unto the surface, hiding myself, and my depth;
yet spreading across, comparing to the span of a lake.
But the sun has scorched half of my waters,
and the remaining drowned into itself:
into the ground, my eventual grave.

Dare to step in? I'll welcome you with a pit.
Care to drain me? I'll gladly concede; before I drown the insects underneath.
Tell the fruit tree about the ordeal,
leave a note tucked in its roots:
"I'm heading back home now, I'll come back next year. I'll see you soon!".
I worry about that tree, if the sun was to catch it parched one day,
I wouldn't be seeing him in the coming rains.

You better fortify this last remaining patch of land, and rid of grass.
I can't bring myself to come back again, the tree isn't looking too well.
Spare me from seeing my sole friend fall unto death;
let my promise rot in vain.

When you go to leave my note,
tell the tree that it shouldn't have faith.
I trust it to make sense of what's then left unsaid.
Let the grass breathe a day after I'm made to leave.
It's too young to comprehend anything you utter;
span your hand across a patch if you must,
but let them breathe another day at least
before sending them too, my way.

You're not responsible for this, I understand.
I was birthed on the wrong patch of land.
And at last, no tears would come;
and I won't gaze at the fruit tree as I leave.
