The stocked timber is finally set ablaze,
the year of the amidst passes away with a whimper lathed breath;
the eyes fail to see as smoke veils the gaze.
I sweat too often, and too much, in turn for tears that never came undone–
and I walk, distant ways; starve to death:
put out the ache that plagues my chest.

Then I saw a man, sharing an eerie resemblance with my tribe;
beaten up, old, sinking into the far end of life.
<i>"Walk upto me, tell me of a real smile, and how to live well."</i>
Next moment we was gone–over to the other end of the park.
In the following round, he stood steps from my bench,
showing his true smile to a squirrel instead,
as it rummaged the pray up its nest.
He chuckled as bliss overtook him, seeing nature in action,
and God at his best.

<i>"When will I see a face concerned with nothing beside me?",</i>
I knew my demand was in vain, but my belief had been long shattered;
leaving me in a free-fall, that Buddha proudly smiled at.
I wondered as he ventured off again, only to be never seen again.
He'd come to pick up her granddaughter 
after she boarded off the same bus I was in half an hour ago, seated next to her.
It was a strange crossing of steps, 
the girl saw me lingering near the park's edge, and rushed the man for home.
<i>"If not for this wretched face, and my horrid self!".</i>
No words would come, I might as well have been deaf!

After a moment, I acted in cowardice and breathed in again,
wanting to never take the path that led me to this bench:
seated in misery, lingering as the pain that long soiled my chest, 
bitten to death by bugs: making every effort to warrant my riddance from this godforsaken bench.

<i>"When Buddha? Your priests deceived you too! And you continue to rest with a smile."</i>
It's a godforsaken rock Sanzhi.
