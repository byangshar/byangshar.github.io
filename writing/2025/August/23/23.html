<pre class="poem-lines">
I drove by an all too familiar road, 
it knows of all I am and 
that which I've been given:
an irredeemable wish, and halted sighs.
Out the window, to the left is a hotel 
I've seen every time I passed by, 
but never cared to visit. 
I'm saving it for the day when 
a ground is formed amid this endless free-fall,
ending my descent.

The impact will shatter my ribs,
corrupt my organs, and bring on my final breaths
as I fail to breathe, yet still trying
desperately, and pathetically to cling
on for a few more godforsaken breaths.

<i>"Oh dear, don't you see it now? This god of yours
has come to grant me the hornets of separation!"</i>

I'll lift my hand out to the sky for the final timeâ€“ 
my wait will come to end as it dies along, 
beholden by the audience of none. 
My last reflections will be those of shame:

<i>"How convenient it was to throw away
all morality away, disregard what my mentors
had to say at will, and still claim to possess 
endless wisdom."</i>

And when the next sun rises unbothered 
by my loss, and my begging hand falls flat,
perhaps you'll too find in yourself 
the forgiveness I begged for ever since we first met.
