Late Mornings, wrought awake, a dissonant choir.
Cheered away, in-contrast silence, and nods and smiles.

Their stumbling notes made their way through the door—
though the desolation earlier imposed, was coaxed to crumble,
as it seeped in, into my abode.

I turned to my side, from the dawning lights, and those futile battle-cries—
birthed by inherited pride, a faith imposed upon the imbecile,
folklore, history, and heritage group as one, backed by records, 
written by unknown-accounts.

One-half of my head considered the odds, shut itself off,
reducing my hearing to half.
It was a final-resort, I soon realised—
I faced my ‘indifferent side’ towards the choir,
in-alignment with their ‘material God’.

No offence was marked, my influence stayed within my abode, alas.

There was never a clear stance taken by either side, 
no clear aggression, or agreement of time—
there’s no duality in a duel of this sort.
What remains is communal disdain towards the indifferent-upsurge.
People worst-hit are those that were ruled in half.

By Evening, no more advances were made.

Late Mornings, for a few more days. Wrought awake, a seldom-distant ache.
God is challenged, Faith is frowned upon, 
a new duality is sought after, 
a new choir begins to march the Mall-Road.
