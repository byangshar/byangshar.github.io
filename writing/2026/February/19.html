<pre class="poem-lines">
Clouds struck, cyclic falls, 
bleak days, sleeves raised, 
re-immersed in summer's tinge;
august offers, performance blight.
Under the sun, a seasonal-thought occurred;
brief spaces, weakened sight, 
conforming to norm, following the word;
brief flights, distant views, 
the hills, and the esplanade;
long strife, convention of man, 
custom of rite, blooming amongst flora, 
decapitating fauna, 
escalating the exploit, forebringing the third reich;
in fear we sustain our standing, 
and earth sinks to naught. <sup>19/2/26</sup>

"Decapitate the hedon! follow the command! 
a bullet in the leg, another in the arm;
induce subsequent harm with a dagger ever so sharp. 
A blow for every malnourished child, 
those that fell victim to death by hunger." <sup>19/2/26</sup>

Then evening commute, a cyclic loop
which works to dissolve time into naught—
grow familiarity en masse.
Sense-perception then grows complacent, 
along with neurons that fight against odds, 
in dearth—this is the onset of the eradication of thought. <sup>8/10/25</sup>

In monotony, stuck in a cave,
in a room, ceiling above—a fan; 
carpet on the floor, tucked by all four sides, 
stretched plain against the floor—
an elaborate cupboard.
The rat must onset the commute before dawn, 
tomorrow again, slay another pawn, 
return home, rejoice:
eat, drink, procreate—entertain.
Stimulate thine cells: fluids propel,
sustain a moment, then sudden crash—
seeking the box, for pills, and sedatives,
enough to put this misery to rest. <sup>19/2/26</sup>

“Resist if you must, believe if you shall, 
your ability is plenty, but this is the plague alas.
Rigour might keep you at bay another week, 
or month, but demise awaits. 
Acceptance can’t be bought, 
remorse is the cost of attempting to fare against the odds;
sail the seas in illusioned mud-water of some pond.” <sup>12/2/26</sup>
