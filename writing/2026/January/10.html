<pre class="poem-lines">
That which is and ought, comes to a sudden, abrupt end.
<i>"Commence!"</i> Fill the theatre, don't let a single penny on the street go.
The janitors were laid off ten minutes ago,
they'll return after the holidays, there's just too much fish to catch;
no time for tidying up carpets, and headrests—the year comes to wrap—
the Capital indulges in sale, and purchase.

How does one become staged in this race?
The legend is passed unto the newborn, as alms, 
the infant inherits the captive state, and the act perpetuates—
the livestock collectively grows out of their infancy, and replicates itself—
forgetting of their condition, presenting those next in-line to serve this system.

<i>"The Capital has existed long before governments were welcomed 
as a body subservient. 
Time withers a rock, the skeleton of the Capital too must have grown porosity 
in its walls—it had started to rely on the government to handle the populous 
and the state."</i>

A lamb descends from the hill top, and chases for the singular-lit home—
it escapes unscathed, now away from danger, and convention—
it was now free from being perpetually enslaved.
But a singular challenge remained: to reap a fruit from the labour, if not a revolution—
to spread the fortune out to a couple generations, to find a mate.
The days ahead were of continuous strife:
vines of creepers with thorns under the shade—
no place to call a moment's worth of rest, 
there was not a single drop of water for several days.
When it descended down into the planes, on an off-chance, 
the week would go to waste—
the traversed plane would open into a sea from all three sides, 
urging it to undo the travel, and return to the hillside.
An urgency was imposed, for the sheep to run as camel—
freedom begged for a meager state, and that of change, and unrest.
How does one live estranged, having escaped from the cage?

The world as the sheep came to know, was much larger than the Capital, 
harnessing several tribes.
It'd fit in one for a month, then be made to leave—
live a camel's life for another gruesome mile.
And when it’d met another sheep, equally estranged; 
the offspring had nurtured at last.
They came to reside in a humid stretch of grass,
here food and water was plenty—its offspring were given in the truest essence,
a life.

The infant saw a world barely contained by any force,
a plethora of chances, possibilities, and advances emerged—
freedom then came in excess, and bewildered the young.
They grew reserved and dormant, barely treading past their homes, 
or a separate tribe, a mate, or a new home, never growing a spine.

The lamb assumed duty until it couldn't:
age started to impose wear on the flesh, 
it'd lived well past the age which its ancestors had come to expect—
and then one after the other leg would come to disobey its will. 

<i>"...it would've been for nothing! They still haven't started to walk, 
for what other cause did I successfully escape, if not to sow a free seed, 
on behalf of everyone that lived for the Capital?
Where was my service flawed?
Which crevice was left untended?"</i>

The lamb had assumed and worked towards a duty, a goal.
From the day it escaped, every step was planned, all until the birth of its child.
It wished for them to be free, and free for all those were slaughtered, 
or enslaved by the Capital.
Who could blame the ambition, who could challenge the conviction, 
who could challenge the devotion—what could tarnish this saint?
All but his understanding of freedom was flawed—it was a miracle it escaped, 
and found a mate, and witnessed the offspring grow. 
They were shaped by a lamb that was too forgiving and docile perhaps, 
the nomadic spirit and bravery had sunsetted a while ago alas. 

Sufficient food, and an empty grassland,
<i>"That is the son of a bastard! A slave!"</i>
Sufficient food, and an empty grassland, 
what was the cost of a season spent playing tag?
Sufficient food, and an empty grassland, 
freedom is never inherited. 
Sufficient food, and an empty grassland, 
The heir is a slave. 
Sufficient food, and an empty grassland! 
<i>"A dream."</i>
Sufficient food, and an empty grassland! 
Sufficient food, and an empty grassland!
Sufficient food, and an empty grassland,
