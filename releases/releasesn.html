"What Remains of the Hidden has been in the works for almost a year, longest I've taken to complete a project thus far. 
I started making the album after my trip to Meghalaya. Mixing the album was particularly hard, I was learning and 
experimenting with a lot of new methods and made outright horrible mixes for months!

I've come to however salvage most if not all tracks, and I think they sound decent, fixed according to what capability
I had; mixing and mastering was the hardest part of the project overall.
In the meanwhile, I have made a website for everything about music releases and writing that I've delved into recently; 
a few months went by as i accustomed to that.
            
I have started working on the next project, I will be publishing tracks of that record soon.
I've unlisted the initial recordings from my main page, you can find them, still, in the playlists tab.

I do realise that this upload has taken far too long. I will be regular going forward, more regular than last year, hopefully!

Thank you all for chiming in!"

"Ceasing Commotion is undoubtedly the most inspiring and educating project I have worked on to date. I delved into 
properly mastering the tracks and into complex music theory stuff. Earlier I didn't think sampling other music 
to be ethical, but the two songs I did sample from Faye Wong definitely made the album 'fuller' for lack of a better word. 
This has also been my longest project yet, probably the one I concluded the quickest in recent history. I was in my last
months of high school when I started working on this, which is why I hold it very close to my heart. I hope you all enjoy
this. Thanks for tuning in!"
