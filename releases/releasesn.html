"What Remains of the Hidden has been in the works for almost a year, longest I've taken to complete a project thus far. 
I started making the album after my trip to Meghalaya. Mixing the album was particularly hard, I was learning and 
experimenting with a lot of new methods and made outright horrible mixes for months!

I've come to however salvage most if not all tracks, and I think they sound decent, fixed according to what capability
I had; mixing and mastering was the hardest part of the project overall.
In the meanwhile, I have made a website for everything about music releases and writing that I've delved into recently; 
a few months went by as i accustomed to that.
            
I have started working on the next project, I will be publishing tracks of that record soon.
I've unlisted the initial recordings from my main page, you can find them, still, in the playlists tab.

I do realise that this upload has taken far too long. I will be regular going forward, more regular than last year, hopefully!

Thank you all for chiming in!"

"The Concubine is my first EP after the event me of changing my alias. Just like always, 3 months of work, a lot of 
frustration and doubt and a desperate attempt to pull this off. I'm still not sure how I feel about this one but I have 
learnt a lot about my music-making habits and distractions that come along the way. Nearing the end of the EP I had gotten 
deep into writer's block and in some ways the release was cut short due to it. Anyway, I hope you all get at least a little 
bit out of this and as always, thanks for tuning in!"
