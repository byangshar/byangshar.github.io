### The purpose of this project/website:
> To make a one-stop destination to route all traffic to my bandcamp, YouTube pages, and maintain a regularly updating poetry, and similar blogs.

The inspiration comes partly from [neocities.org](https://neocities.org/browse), 
but I wanted to learn web design more extensively, and Github suited more
to me at the time of creation; and that was a while ago, and I haven't had
any issues so far, so I've stuck.

And that's about it. This is a personal website project.

## Next Planned Improvements:

### Adding all writing from previous website (list):
May
Out of Commission (added) 


April
Offshore, tucked aside
Sole light in deep blue (added)
Never depart from Lhasa
To fall off a cliff (added)

…And so, we continued to stay here.


May
Evening Saudade  
The Twenty-Fourth Hour 
Amidst, Cluster, Exile (added)
Recital from the Edge, onlooking the start 
This spiral falls apart, as it reaches the end. 
In-between moments 
We wished for their un-impending doom 
Settling on a Name, a Date, and Away.
"Catch the morning rays, no matter what!" 


June
Seldom Stay Afloat. 
“…to deplore until ripe of age.”
