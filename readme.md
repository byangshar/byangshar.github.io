### The purpose of this project/website:
> To make a one-stop destination to route all traffic to my bandcamp, YouTube pages, and maintain a regularly updating poetry, and similar blogs.

The inspiration comes partly from [neocities.org](https://neocities.org/browse), 
but I wanted to learn web design more extensively, and Github suited more
to me at the time of creation; and that was a while ago, and I haven't had
any issues so far, so I've stuck.

And that's about it. This is a personal website project.

------------

## Next Planned Improvements:
* Better fluidity, specially the Writing page's mobile page.
* Streamlining all CSS by adding the border tags into root.
* Unifying Regular and Responsive Fonts and Colours into variables.
