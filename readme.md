### The purpose of this project/website:
> To make a one-stop destination to route all traffic to my bandcamp, YouTube pages, and maintain a regularly updating poetry, and similar blogs.

The inspiration comes partly from [neocities.org](https://neocities.org/browse), 
but I wanted to learn web design more extensively, and Github suited more
to me at the time of creation; and that was a while ago, and I haven't had
any issues so far, so I've stuck.

And that's about it. This is a personal website project.

## Next Planned Improvements:
NONE. (my college started :/)

## Executed Improvements:
* a global css file that governs font sizes and <div> tags that're held in common by all pages.

* Common font reduced to a normal size (1.1rem) of the Walkthrough, and Photobook Page.

> edited: 23rd August 2025.

## Notes
* the global font size is **1.3rem**
* Navigation has a unique value of **1rem**, its responsive font-size being **1.1rem**
