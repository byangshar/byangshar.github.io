<pre class="poem-lines">
Darkness overlapping its bars,
Got a view of the heavenly stars.
Looking for a change in itself,
Replaced its heart to wealth.
Thus was the light formed,
Winding off all the storms,

Caring for something it did not have,
The dark eclipsed its positive naive.
Now considered a being of Satan,
Had created the light, the world around which wondered.

Satan regarded with dark, 
God fulfilled by lighted,
This was all a piece of superstition,
Each what dark  had created.

Now considered a wealthy being,
Was the light instead of the cause to its living.
When was the light in its most,
Its creator, the darkness remained as a demonly ghost.
