    <i>"What Remains of the Hidden has been in the works for almost a year, longest I've taken to complete a project thus far. I started making the album after my trip to Meghalaya. 
    <br>
    Mixing the album was particularly hard, I was learning and experimenting with a lot of new methods and made outright horrible mixes for months!
    <br>
    I've come to however salvage most if not all tracks, and I think they sound decent, fixed according to what capability I had; 
    mixing and mastering was the hardest part of the project overall.
    <br>
    In the meanwhile, I have made a website for everything about music releases and writing that I've delved into recently; 
    a few months went by as i accustomed to that.
    <br>
    I have started working on the next project, I will be publishing tracks of that record soon.
    <br>
    I've unlisted the initial recordings from my main page, you can find them, still, in the playlists tab.
    <br>
    I do realise that this upload has taken far too long. I will be regular going forward, more regular than last year, hopefully!
    <br>
    Thank you all for chiming in!"</i>
