                        <p>I made this page to present updates about various matters in a more candid way. 
                            I plan to keep this page less-developed, the way it is, which allows me to keep pushing the aforementioned updates
                            onto here. </p></div>

                        <p>At the start of the new year, I have posted my first prose-poem. The writing page is a bit of a cluttered mess at the moment,
                            I don't have any knowledge of js, and hence can't really develop that page, or the site further how I'd want. I am keen on
                            learning though, and I plan to execute the planned changes in due time.
