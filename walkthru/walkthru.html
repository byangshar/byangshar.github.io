                <p class="aa">I made this website initially to make a comprehensive place to showcase
                    all the 'art' that I make. But recently, I've be quite inspired by
                    the creators over at
                    <a href="https://neocities.org/" target="_blank" class="links">neocities.org</a>.
                    I plan to expand the website <i >(as long as Github keeps me abode)</i> 
                    into more extensive writing, accompanied with an archive of all my music releases.
                    I've also planned to write raw commentaries on topics that interest me, sometime
                    in the near future.

                    This is still in the works. For the meantime, you can view the archive
                    I made on my

                Buying the Album over there would be the best way to support me. You can also stream the
                album over there if you have a fued with YouTube for some reason. Thank you for whatever
                you can do!</div>
